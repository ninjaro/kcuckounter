 * units as the arguments passed to card_packer::pack().

 * - The origin (0, 0) is at the top-left corner of the packed rectangle.
 * - The x axis grows to the right.
 * - The y axis grows downward.
 *
 * A card is always axis-aligned (no arbitrary rotation; only 0 or 90 degrees).
 * The effective width and height of the card depend on the global scale chosen
 * by card_packer::pack() and on the @ref placed_card::rotated flag:
 *
 * - Let H0 = card_ratio.first  and W0 = card_ratio.second.
 * - Let s be the final scale returned by card_packer::pack().
 *
 * If rotated == false:
 *   - width  = s * H0  (along +X),
 *   - height = s * W0  (along +Y).
 *
 * If rotated == true:
 *   - width  = s * W0  (along +X),
 *   - height = s * H0  (along +Y).

/**
 * @brief Packs a fixed number of equal-sized cards into a rectangular area.
 *
 * This class computes a uniform isotropic scale factor and axis-aligned
 * positions for a requested number of identical rectangular cards so that:
 *
 *  - every card lies completely inside the [0, width] x [0, height]
 *    bounding box passed to card_packer::pack(),
 *  - cards do not overlap at the scale and positions chosen by the algorithm,
 *  - the scale is as large as possible under these constraints
 *    (within a fixed numeric tolerance),
 *  - the returned vector contains at most @ref card_count placements.
 *
 * The algorithm:
 *  - treats a card as having a fixed aspect ratio (see @ref card_ratio),
 *  - performs a binary search on the uniform scale factor in the range
 *    [0, max_scale(width, height, card_count)],
 *  - for each candidate scale, uses a recursive "frame" filling pattern that
 *    tries to place cards along the outer boundary of the area (forming one
 *    or more rectangular frames) and then recurses into the remaining
 *    inner region,
 *  - keeps track of all successfully placed cards for that scale.
 *
 * The final call to pack() returns:
 *  - the largest scale for which the recursion was able to place at least
 *    @ref card_count cards in total,
 *  - a vector of up to card_count @ref placed_card entries.
 *
 * **Important detail about the returned vector:**
 *
 * The internal recursion tends to place border "frame" cards first and more
 * central cards later. After the final packing pass, the implementation keeps
 * only the *tail* (last) card_count placements from the chronological
 * placement order. This typically results in a more centered cluster of cards
 * being returned to the caller, rather than the entire outer frame.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * @code
 *   card_packer packer(52);               // target: 52 cards
 *   auto [scale, cards] = packer.pack(    // width = 800, height = 600
 *       800.0,
 *       600.0
 *   );
 *   // 'scale' is the common scale factor for all cards.
 *   // 'cards' contains up to 52 placed_card instances.
 * @endcode
 *
 * Thread-safety:
 *  - card_packer holds mutable state and is not thread-safe.
 *  - do not call pack() concurrently from multiple threads on the same
 *    instance.
